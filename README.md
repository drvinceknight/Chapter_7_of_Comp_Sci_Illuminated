Repo containing some code relevant to Chapter 7 of the excellent [Computer Science illuminated by Dale and Lewis book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Computer-Science-Illuminated-Nell-Dale/dp/1449672841/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369398877&sr=8-1&keywords=computer+science+illuminated).

This repo contains 8 simple scripts that cover 3 basic ideas in computer science:

1. Search algorithms
2. Sorting algorithms
3. The above using recursion

# Search algorithms

There are two scripts here:

- `square_root.py`, this doesn't have anything to do with search algorithms but is featured in the book as an example of of writing pseudo code so I've included it. More information on the sequence used can be found at [this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method).
- `binary_search_for_sorted_array.py`, a [simple iterative binary search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).

# Sorting algorithms

There are three scripts here:

- `selection_sort.py`, a [simple selection sort algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort).
- `bubble_sort.py`, a [simple bubble sort algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort).
- `insertion_sort.py`, a [simple insertion sort algorithm. Insertion is a simple modification of bubble sort which make it quite efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort).

# Recursive algorithms

Recursion is a very powerful idea in computer science that allows for a major speed gain in programming. Here are a couple of scripts that make use of recursion.

- `recursive_factorial.py`, a [simple algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Recursion_in_computer_science).
- `recursive_binary_search_for_sorted_array.py`, a [modification of the above binary search algorithm that makes use of recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).
- `quick_sort.py`, an [efficient sorting algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort).
